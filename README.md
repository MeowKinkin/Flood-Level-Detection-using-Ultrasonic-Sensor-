# Flood-Level-Detection-using-Ultrasonic-Sensor-
i used a ultra sonic sensor to measure the flood raise level using some mathematics, a buzzer as a alarm, three LEDs to indicate the danger level and a arduino board.
The ultra sonic sensor basically measures the distance between the water level and it. Based on the water level, the led glows for different colors and the buzzer beeps only if the danger level is high.
